### Special thanks to [nismo1337](https://github.com/nismo1337) for creating the code, as well for helping me out with cloud hosting.

## Dynamic Image Website
Fairly simply JavaScript code that randomly changes the image displayed on the site every second.

- I currently use [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) to host all of this. (Price: Around $7.00 every month)
- Please make sure you follow the instructions closely on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) in order to avoid messing anything up.
- The ['.bat' file included](https://github.com/its-Jaxx/Dynamic-Image-Website/blob/main/git_commit.bat) may need some tweaking, or you can type each command individually in your [Windows Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Terminal). You should run every command in the file every time you make a change (Adding, removing, changing images, etc.)
